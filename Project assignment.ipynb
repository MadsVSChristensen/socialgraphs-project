One of the problems was the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; Given a number **n**, write a function in C/C++ that returns the sum of the digits of the number *squared*. (The following is important). The *range* of **n** is [ -(10^7), 10^7 ]. Example: If **n** = 123, your function should return 14 (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the function that I wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n    int sum_of_digits_squared(int n) \\r\\n    {\\r\\n        int s = 0, c;\\r\\n\\r\\n        while (n) {\\r\\n            c = n % 10;\\r\\n            s += (c * c);\\r\\n            n /= 10;\\r\\n        }\\r\\n\\r\\n        return s;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\nLooked right to me. So now the test came back and I found that the teacher didn&#39;t give me all the points for a reason that I do not understand. According to him, for my function to be complete, I should&#39;ve have added the following detail:\\r\\n\\r\\n    int sum_of_digits_squared(int n) \\r\\n     {\\r\\n        int s = 0, c;\\r\\n\\r\\n        if (n == 0) {      //\\r\\n            return 0;      //\\r\\n        }                  //\\r\\n                           // THIS APPARENTLY SHOULD&#39;VE \\r\\n        if (n &lt; 0) {       // BEEN IN THE FUNCTION FOR IT\\r\\n            n = n * (-1);  // TO BE CORRECT\\r\\n        }                  //\\r\\n                          \\r\\n        while (n) {\\r\\n            c = n % 10;\\r\\n            s += (c * c);\\r\\n            n /= 10;\\r\\n        }\\r\\n\\r\\n        return s;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\nThe argument for this is that the number **n** is in the range [-(10^7), 10^7], so it can be a negative number. But I don&#39;t see where my own version of the function fails. If I understand correctly, the meaning of `while(n)` is `while(n != 0)`, **not** `while (n &gt; 0)`, so in my version of the function the number **n** wouldn&#39;t fail to enter the loop. It would work just the same. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen, I tried both versions of the function on my computer at home and I got exactly the same answers for all the examples that I tried. So, `sum_of_digits_squared(-123)` is equal to `sum_of_digits_squared(123)` (which again, is equal to `14`) (even without the detail that I apparently should&#39;ve added). Indeed, if I try to print on the screen the digits of the number (from least to greatest in importance), in the `123` case I get `3 2 1` and in the `-123` case I get `-3 -2 -1` (which is actually kind of interesting). But in this problem it wouldn&#39;t matter since we square the digits. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, who&#39;s wrong?\\r\\n\\r\\n**EDIT**: My bad, I forgot to specify and didn&#39;t know it was important. The version of C used in our class and tests has to be C99 or **newer**. So I guess (by reading the comments) that my version would get the correct answer in any way.',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>I have very frequently seen people discouraging others from using <code>scanf</code> and saying that there are better alternatives. However, all I end up seeing is either <em>\"don\\'t use <code>scanf</code>\"</em> or <em>\"here\\'s a correct format string\"</em>, and never any examples of the <em>\"better alternatives\"</em> mentioned.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, let\\'s take this snippet of code:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>scanf(\"%c\", &amp;c);\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This reads the whitespace that was left in the input stream after the last conversion. The usual suggested solution to this is to use:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>scanf(\" %c\", &amp;c);\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>or to not use <code>scanf</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Since <code>scanf</code> is bad, what are some ANSI C options for converting input formats that <code>scanf</code> can usually handle (such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings) without using <code>scanf</code>?</p>\\n'},\n",

       "   'body_markdown': '###Objective and Motivation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `MultiIndex` API has been gaining popularity over the years, however, not everything about it is fully understood in terms of the structure, working, and associated operations. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne important operation is _filtering_. Filtering is a common requirement, but the use cases are diverse. Accordingly, certain methods and functions will be more applicable to some use cases than others. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, the aim of this post is to touch upon some common filtering problems and use cases, demonstrate various different methods to solve these problems, and discuss their applicability. Some of the high-level questions this post seeks to address are\\r\\n\\r\\n - Slicing based on a single value/label\\r\\n - Slicing based on multiple labels from one or more levels\\r\\n - Filtering on boolean conditions and expressions\\r\\n - Which methods are applicable in what circumstances\\r\\n\\r\\nThese problems have been broken down into 6 concrete questions, enumerated below. For simplicity, the example DataFrames in the setup below only have two levels, and do not have duplicate index keys.
