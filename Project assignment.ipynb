One of the problems was the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; Given a number **n**, write a function in C/C++ that returns the sum of the digits of the number *squared*. (The following is important). The *range* of **n** is [ -(10^7), 10^7 ]. Example: If **n** = 123, your function should return 14 (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the function that I wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n    int sum_of_digits_squared(int n) \\r\\n    {\\r\\n        int s = 0, c;\\r\\n\\r\\n        while (n) {\\r\\n            c = n % 10;\\r\\n            s += (c * c);\\r\\n            n /= 10;\\r\\n        }\\r\\n\\r\\n        return s;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\nLooked right to me. So now the test came back and I found that the teacher didn&#39;t give me all the points for a reason that I do not understand. According to him, for my function to be complete, I should&#39;ve have added the following detail:\\r\\n\\r\\n    int sum_of_digits_squared(int n) \\r\\n     {\\r\\n        int s = 0, c;\\r\\n\\r\\n        if (n == 0) {      //\\r\\n            return 0;      //\\r\\n        }                  //\\r\\n                           // THIS APPARENTLY SHOULD&#39;VE \\r\\n        if (n &lt; 0) {       // BEEN IN THE FUNCTION FOR IT\\r\\n            n = n * (-1);  // TO BE CORRECT\\r\\n        }                  //\\r\\n                          \\r\\n        while (n) {\\r\\n            c = n % 10;\\r\\n            s += (c * c);\\r\\n            n /= 10;\\r\\n        }\\r\\n\\r\\n        return s;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\nThe argument for this is that the number **n** is in the range [-(10^7), 10^7], so it can be a negative number. But I don&#39;t see where my own version of the function fails. If I understand correctly, the meaning of `while(n)` is `while(n != 0)`, **not** `while (n &gt; 0)`, so in my version of the function the number **n** wouldn&#39;t fail to enter the loop. It would work just the same. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen, I tried both versions of the function on my computer at home and I got exactly the same answers for all the examples that I tried. So, `sum_of_digits_squared(-123)` is equal to `sum_of_digits_squared(123)` (which again, is equal to `14`) (even without the detail that I apparently should&#39;ve added). Indeed, if I try to print on the screen the digits of the number (from least to greatest in importance), in the `123` case I get `3 2 1` and in the `-123` case I get `-3 -2 -1` (which is actually kind of interesting). But in this problem it wouldn&#39;t matter since we square the digits. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, who&#39;s wrong?\\r\\n\\r\\n**EDIT**: My bad, I forgot to specify and didn&#39;t know it was important.

Seems like it would just replace the input with itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are TONS of other directives around it, but the only one that appears to have any bearing just checked if it\\'s defined: <code>#ifndef PROTOTYPE</code>. I found some places in HDF4 header files that do this: <code>#define PROTOTYPE</code>. So, none of that really clear up my question. Still seems pretty useless.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here\\'s how it\\'s used: </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>CS_RETCODE clientmsg_callback PROTOTYPE((\\nCS_CONTEXT * context,\\nCS_CONNECTION *connection,\\nCS_CLIENTMSG *clientmsg));\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This is part of a project which uses Sybase Open Client. clientmsg_callback is later used here:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>ct_callback(context, NULL, CS_SET, CS_CLIENTMSG_CB,\\n                  (CS_VOID *)clientmsg_callback);\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m going off of a sample program from here:</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.infocenter.dc35570.1570/html/clcprgde/clcprgde10.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.infocenter.dc35570.1570/html/clcprgde/clcprgde10.htm</a></p>\\n\\n<p>clientmsg_callback is implemented later. I think the sample was originally written with C in mind, instead of C++. Perhaps that has something to do with it?</p>\\n'},\n",
